# Python break, continue, and pass statements

- break
    - This statement is used to bring the program control out of the loop.


- continue
    - This statement is used to bring the program control to the beginning of the loop.
    - The statement skips the remaining lines of code inside the loop and start with the next iteration.

- pass
    - This is a null operation due to the fact that nothing happens when it is executed.
