# Python Variables

- What are variables?
    - A variable is an identifier that is used to refer to a memory location.
    - Python is a dynamically typed language, so we don't need to specify the type of variable.

- Rules to name a variable
    - First character must be an alphabet(A-Z or a-z) or underscore(_).
    - Identifiers mustn't contain whitespaces or special character like !,@,%,*...
    - Variable names should not be the same as any python keyword.
    - Variable names are case sensitive. E.g. 'name' is not the same as 'Name'
