# Python Loops

- Loops are used to alter the flow of the program
- Loops provides code re-usability
- Looping simplifies complex problems into easy ones
- Through loops, we can go through elements of data structures.

- Types of loops
    - for loop
    - while loop
    - do-while loop

    - for loop (per-tested loop)
        - It is used where we need to execute some part of the code until a given condition is satisfied.
        - It is used when the number of iteration is known in advance.

    - while loop (pre-tested loop)
        - It is used when we don't know the number of iterations in advance.

    - do-while loop (post-tested loop)
        - It is used when it is necessary to execute the loop at least once(like in: menu driven programs)
